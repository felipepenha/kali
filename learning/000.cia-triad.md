# The CIA Triad

The CIA Triad is a core model in cybersecurity that guides the protection of information. It is represented as an equilateral triangle because all three elements are considered to have equal weight, and if any element is lost, the triangle is broken.

The three elements are:

1.  **Confidentiality**
2.  **Integrity**
3.  **Availability**

In some industrial settings, the priority is reversed, sometimes referred to as the AIC triad (Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality).

Here is a brief breakdown of each element:

| Element | Goal | Protection Mechanisms |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Confidentiality** | Ensures information is only accessible and readable by authorized users. | Encryption and Access Controls (Identification, Authentication, Authorization). |
| **Integrity** | Ensures that data is accurate, unaltered, and has not been modified or corrupted through unauthorized or unintentional changes. | Hashing, Digital Signatures, Authentication Header (AH), and File Integrity Monitoring (FIM). |
| **Availability** | Ensures that information and systems are accessible and usable when needed by authorized users. | Redundancy, Fault Tolerance, and Backup Systems. |
